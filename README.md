# Django Modern Admin

Django Modern Admin is an open-source project that provides a sleek, modern, and highly customizable administrative interface for Django projects, built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. It aims to replace the standard Django admin with a more user-friendly and feature-rich frontend, while still leveraging the power and flexibility of Django's backend.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI**: A beautiful and responsive interface built with Next.js and the best-in-class shadcn/ui component library.
- **Dynamic Model Views**: Automatically generates list, create, and edit views for your Django models.
- **AI-Powered Generation**:
  - **Content Generation**: In any model's form view, use the "Generate with AI" button to populate fields based on a natural language prompt. The system is smart enough to understand your model's schema for accurate data creation.
  - **AI Utilities**: A dedicated "AI Tools" section with utilities like a secure password generator.
- **Customizable**: Configure navigation, model display, and more through simple configuration files.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports light and dark themes.
- **Internationalization**: Ready for multi-language support with next-intl.
